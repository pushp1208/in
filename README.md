# Registration Table SQL Script

This repository contains a sample SQL script for creating a 'Registration' table and implementing CRUD operations.

## Prerequisites

- Install a SQL database system such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite on your local machine.

## Steps to Run

1. Open your SQL database management tool or command-line interface.

2. Copy the SQL script provided in the `registration_table.sql` file and paste it into your SQL database management tool or execute it using the command-line interface.

3. Once the script is executed, the 'Registration' table will be created in your database.

4. You can then use SQL commands to perform CRUD operations on the 'Registration' table. For example:
   - To create a new record, use the `INSERT` command.
   - To retrieve records, use the `SELECT` command.
   - To update an existing record, use the `UPDATE` command.
   - To delete a record, use the `DELETE` command.

5. You can also integrate this SQL code with your preferred programming language and framework to build a complete application.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that you have appropriate permissions to create tables and perform CRUD operations in your SQL database.

- Modify the SQL script as needed to fit the specific requirements of your application.

- For more advanced usage, consider using stored procedures, triggers, and indexes to optimize the performance of your database operations.
